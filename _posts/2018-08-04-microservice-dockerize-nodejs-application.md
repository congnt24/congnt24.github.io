## I. Prerequisite
1.  Knowledge node.js basic
2.  Understand Docker basic

## II. Concept
**Docker**: is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. It is a bit like a virtual machine but It is not create a whole operating system.

<!--more-->

**Image**: is a static specification of what the container should be in runtime, including the application code inside the container and runtime configuration settings. Docker images contain read-only layers, which means that once an image is created it is never modified.

**Container**:  A running Docker container is an instantiation of an image. Unlike images, which are read-only, running containers include a writable layer.

**Dockerfile**: is a text document that contains all of the configuration information and commands needed to assemble a container image. With a Dockerfile, the Docker daemon can automatically build a container image.

**Microservice**:

## III. Why you should dockerize your application

## IV. Setup
### 1. Create simple nodejs service
### 2. Dockerfile
### 3. Build Image and run application
## V. Publish
